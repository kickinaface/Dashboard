# Dashboard

This is the living source code of the NodeJS application: my-dashboard-app.

## Features

- User Profile (Build a unique profile with avatar link and color themes.)
- Messages (with Text and Email notifications.)
- File Manager (Configure to machines. Linux works best. Admin accounts and user roles)
- Task Manager (Add, Remove & Edit tasks along with team members. View live edits.)

## Installation

Dashbord requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

You must follow the configuration parameters of your administrator before installing and running the application correctly. These settings are not described here. Refer to your adminstrator for the appropriate configuration settings.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
